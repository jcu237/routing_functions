# ConnectedComponents.jl

**ConnectedComponents.jl** is a Julia package for studying the **connectivity of real algebraic varieties** using *routing functions*.  

The package implements algorithms from

This paper introduces the use of **routing functions** â€” rational functions whose gradient flows reveal the connected components of a real algebraic variety.  
`ConnectedComponents.jl` automates this process, providing an efficient framework for computing critical points and tracking gradient paths.

Several examples are included in 'testing.jl'. 

Comments and suggestions are welcome!
